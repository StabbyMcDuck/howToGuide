<h1>Authenticating your key</h1>
<h3>the business of getting your key to work</h3>
<p>
    There are two ways to authenticate your API key: Authenticating using an HTTP basic
    authentication or using OAuth. <br>
    <br>

    <!-- HTTP basic auth -->
    <strong>HTTP basic authentication</strong> is used if you just need to sign in to your Ravelry account remotely.
    This will be done in the terminal.  You will need your <strong>personal key</strong> and your
    <strong>access key</strong>.  Both of these keys can be found in your pro account page.  <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp &nbsp <strong><em>Pro tip:</em></strong> Your access key, personal key, and secret key are
        all different and are not interchangeable!<br>
    <br>
    Below is an example of HTTP basic authentication.  To run this, open up terminal and run the following: <br>
    <br>
        <code>
            &nbsp &nbsp curl -u <i>access_key:personal_key</i> https://api.ravelry.com/color_families.json
        </code>
    <br>
    <br>
    In this example, you would substitute your access key and your personal key, but you type in
    https://api.ravelry.com/color_families.json exactly as it is written.  This is a JSON call and it will determine
    your user name based on your access key and personal key.  <br>
    <br>
    The output for this example is:
    <script src="https://gist.github.com/StabbyMcDuck/f31842aa357971c64a74.js"></script>

    <!-- OAuth -->
    <strong>OAuth</strong> is a better choice of authenticating, mainly because you can safely give an application
    your permissions without giving out your key information.  This makes it a more secure way to access of Ravelry.<br>
    Ravelry specifically uses OAuth 1.0a.<br>
    There are several
    <a href="http://oauth.net/code/">OAuth Libraries</a> that could be used, depending on what sorts of projects you have in mind. <br>
    A couple that are known to work well with Ravelry are:<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp<a href="https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFOAuth1Client">AFNetworking/AFOAuth1Client</a> &nbsp (Objective-C)<br>

    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp<a href="https://github.com/oauth-xx/oauth-ruby">oauth-ruby</a> &nbsp (Ruby)<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    The OAuth URLs are:<br>
    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <a href="https://www.ravelry.com/oauth/request_token">https://www.ravelry.com/oauth/request_token</a> <br>
    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <a href="https://www.ravelry.com/oauth/access_token">https://www.ravelry.com/oauth/access_token</a> <br>
    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <a href="https://www.ravelry.com/oauth/authorize">https://www.ravelry.com/oauth/authorize</a> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp &nbsp <strong><em>Pro tip:</em></strong> OAuth tokens will expire, either when a user revokes access or after
    a period of inactivity.  For this reason, remember to include a <strong>HTTP 401 Unauthorized</strong> error in your
    application.<br>
    <br>

    For more information about the specifics of OAuth 1.0, please see
        <a href="http://oauth.net/core/1.0/">http://oauth.net/core/1.0/</a>.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>OAuth Permissions</strong><br>
    The <code>request_token</code> URL, <code>http://www.ravelry.com/oauth/request_token?scope=forum-write+message-write</code>,
    takes an optional 'scope' parameter that can be used when your application needs to request privileges that are not included by
    default. <br>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Key</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>forum-write</td>
        <td>Create, edit, or delete forum posts</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>message-write</td>
        <td>Create, send, or delete messages</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>patternstore-read</td>
        <td>List the pattern stores (and the products in the store) that the user administers</td>
    </tr>
</table>
    <br>
    &nbsp &nbsp <strong><em>Pro tip:</em></strong> you don't need to request these permissions if you are using a
    personal key instead of OAuth.<br>
    <br>

    <strong>HTTP Status Codes</strong><br>
    The following are error codes you may come across:

    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Error code #</th>
            <th>Error code</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>400</td>
            <td>Bad Request</td>
            <td>Invalid API call.  Check the parameters!</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>401</td>
            <td>Unauthorized</td>
            <td>OAuth token has expired or user revoked access.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>403</td>
            <td>Forbidden</td>
            <td>Invalid OAuth token, invalid API key(s), or user is not permitted to use that method</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>404</td>
            <td>Not Found</td>
            <td>Resource no longer exists.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>405</td>
            <td>Method Not Allowed</td>
            <td>You attempted to GET a POST or POST a GET.  Double check!</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>413</td>
            <td>Request Entity Too Large</td>
            <td>Your POST is too large!</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>500</td>
            <td>Server Error</td>
            <td>An error on Ravelry's side.  Report the bug!</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>503</td>
            <td>Service Unavailable</td>
            <td>Ravelry's API is not available.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>504</td>
            <td>Gateway Time-out</td>
            <td>The request was cancelled because it took >10s to generate the
            response.</td>
        </tr>

    </table>
    <br>

    Now that we can log in to Ravelry remotely and aren't violating any Terms of Service rules, we can get
    started getting some data from Ravelry!
